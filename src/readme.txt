Enable SVG uploads in Media Library and other file upload fields.

== Description ==
This plugin enables SVG uploads in WordPress Media Library with very little overhead.

#### Feedback

Please feel free to [suggest](https://github.com/Lewiscowles1986/WordPressSVGPlugin/issues) improvements, report conflicts, and/or make suggestions for hooks to integrate with third-party plugins.

#### Updates

Automatic updates are currently supported via [GitHub Updater](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater).

== Installation ==
Download and extract the zip file or clone this repo to your WordPress plugins directory.

After an upgrade to 2.x it may be necessary to download and re-upload your SVG media files so that the grid works. This is because we now use simple XML to retrieve the width & height of the SVG.
